## License Plate Recognition Computer Vision Project

In todayâ€™s digital age, the demand for efficient and accurate automated systems continues to grow. One such application is License Plate Recognition (LPR), 

a technology that combines computer vision and image processing techniques to identify and interpret license plates from images in various scenarios.

Project Overview:

The project focuses on implementing a License Plate Recognition system using computer vision algorithms. Key objectives include:

Character Segmentation: Identifying individual characters on the license plate to facilitate accurate recognition.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Using machine learning models to recognize and interpret characters from images.

Technologies and Tools:

The project utilizes Python as the primary programming language due to its extensive libraries for computer vision and machine learning, including OpenCV or sklearn. 

These tools enable us to build a scalable and efficient solution capable of processing images and videos in real-time.

Expected Outcomes:

Upon completion, this project aims to achieve high accuracy in license plate recognition across various conditions, including different lighting conditions OR angles. 

The system's performance will be evaluated through comprehensive testing and validation against benchmark datasets and real-world scenarios.
